1. Home Page:
    1. Show recently listed NFTs
        1. if you own the NFTs, you can update the listing
        2. if not, you can buy the listing

2. Sell Page:
    1. You can list your NFT on the marketplace

So in general, we will just have two pages in total.

Now the index.js will be the Home Page
While sell-nft.js will be the Sell Page
